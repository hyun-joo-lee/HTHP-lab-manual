# Carbon Coating Probe Samples
1. Start with the four switches in the top row (left to right): down, up, down, up (That is, Power Off; Manual; Oper; Manual Flash positions.)
2. The bottom row of six switches should be all down. (That is, all in the Off or Closed positions.)
3. The VACUUM GAUGE toggle switch should be up (in the On position).

4. Turn on the white main POWER switch (extreme left of top row).
5. Turn on SYSTEM VENT switch (middle of bottom row). (Hisss).
6. Lift the protection metal basket, rotate it a little to the right to lock it in place, and carefully lift the bell jar as high as it will go. Put it down on little holder.

7. Sharpen one side of the carbon rod, the length will be about 1/4 inch. This is because to prevent break and convey enough amount of resistance to the rod. Replace sharpen part to be in the center and adjust the tension on the carbon rod.
8. Clean the brass sample holders (in the golden box in the cabinet next to the coater) with ethanol. Distribute your samples and the brass sample holders evenly in the holders.

9. Use your hands to feel around the bottom of the bell jar gasket and the surface of the metal base it will rest on. You're looking for glass partilces, dirt, or any extraneous matter and simultaneously giving the seal a slight greasing. If either surface feels grittier than normal, note it in the Instrument Log and get help.
10. Turn to release, and very carefully lower the bell jar. When it's resting on the plate, push down on it while trying to turn it a little, to ensure a better seal.

11. Close SYSTEM VENT (middle of bottom row).
12. Turn on MECHANICAL PUMP (extreme left of lower row). (Low pumping sounds).
13. Turn on VACUUM VALVE (middle of lower row) and pump to 200 milliTorr on the Thermocouple Gauge. This takes a few minutes.
14. Turn on DIFFUSION PUMP (lower row, second from left) and wait 10-15 minutes for it to warm up. When you turn on DIFFUSION PUMP, make sure your eye keep on the Thermocouple Gauge. If it goes up above 500milliTorr, you should turn off immediately. When the Thermocouple Gauge is far up to 0 and it is swaying slightly, it is ready to go.

15. Switch ROTARY TABLE CONTROL to Manual: from middle position to up (lower left side of the panel).
16. Rotate the SPEED CONTROL knob above it clockwise to the desired speed (see video).
17. Make sure the large black FLASH POWER ADJUST knob is Off (fully counter-clockwise).
18. Turn on FLASH POWER (lower row, extreme right).

19. Increase current on the FLASH POWER ADJUST until the carbon rod begins to faintly glow red (approx. 20mA on the Filament Current Gauge). Wait about five or ten seconds for it to degas.

20. Evaporate the carbon: Make sure you do not see the rod directly. With the FLASH POWER ADJUST knob, __steadily and carefully increase__ the current until the carbon rod begins to sputter. Reduce the current slightly and left sputter for a few seconds or until the brass sample holders turn purplish blue-grey (requires a clean belljar).
21. As soon as the brass holders turn purple, turn off FLASH POWER ADJUST (fully counter-clockwise) quickly.

22. Turn off FLASH POWER.
23. Turn off ROTARY SPEED CONTROL (fully counter-clockwise).
24. Turn off ROTARY TABLE toggle switch (to center position).
25. Turn off DIFFUSION PUMP and wait 10 minutes for it to cool down. This is because the oil is still hot and if you vent right away, the oil can be scattered and it can lead to fire.

26. Close VACUUM VALVE.
27. Turn on SYSTEM VENT (hisss).
28. Lift and secure the bell jar.
29. Remove your samples.

(To repeat the procedure with mores samples, start again at #7.)

30. Clean the belljar with Windex.
31. Examine sealing surfaces and carefully replace the belljar.

32. Close SYSTEM VENT.
33. Turn on VACUUM VALVE and pump to 200milliTorr.
34. Close VACUUM VALVE.
35. Turn off MECHANICAL PUMP.
36. Turn M.P. Vent on, then off again after a short hiss (bottom row, second from right).
37. Turn off white Main POWER switch.
