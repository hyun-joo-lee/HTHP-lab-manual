# Cutting Tube
- __Supply__: tube, blade, ruler, blank metal
- Choose tube material and size with respect to your purpose (Au / Pt / Au-Pd / …)
- Find a blank stick which fits perfectly with the tube and insert the stick into the tube to prevent deformation of tube during cutting (especially gold is easy to deform).

- Consider that some part can be lost while making the capsule, measure 1 ~ 1.2 cm and __gently__ cut straight by blade to prevent deformation of the tube.
- When you cut about half around the tube, make sure a blank stick is pushed into the line you made by the blade.

- Stress on the score to break the tube, with confidence __but carefully__ not to deform the round tube end. If it does not break all, bent several times to perfectly detach the capsule from tube.

# Annealation
Annealation is the process to remove dirt and other elements on the capsule which keeps from contamination. The flame can combust elements such as carbon or water on the temperature around 1700ºC.
- __Supply__: ceramic stick
- Prepare long enough ceramic stick to protect your hands.
- Turn on the gases. Rotate the quarter of gas valve of H2 and O2. When you rotate the valve, the gas gauge will rise. Make sure switch the mark from off to on.

- Red valve is hydrogen and green valve is oxygen. __First, Hydrogen valve must turn on a little bit. Unless there is a risk of explosion.__ Then, you make a spark with the fire starter.   

<img width="401" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146051633-cefc0f03-f014-4d78-ac90-a9075b707efc.png">  

- Then you can turn on the oxygen valve very gently until you can see the small blue flame from the discharge area.
- Put your capsule on the ceramic stick. Heating the tube until it looks orange. The tube melt in 3 seconds with the flame, so you don't want to stay your capsule too long in the flame. Repeat this step about 3 or 4 times.

- The capsule is really hot, be careful not to touch it. Ceramic stick is low heat conductor but heated part is hot, also be careful.
- When you want to turn off the fire, the order is opposite. First, You must turn off the oxygen. Then, turn off the hydrogen. __Double-check.__
- Turn off the gas tank both of H2 and O2. Make sure switch the mark from on to off. Time goes by, the gas gauge will go down.
- Wait until the tubes cool down about two or three minutes, make sure do not contaminate the capsule with hands or other materials. 

# Enclosing
To symmetrically enclose the tube, you will use the tools.
- __Supply__: enclosing machine, holed plate
- Place the capsule on the holed plate.

- Enclose about half with the machine.  

<img width="191" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146259734-a9f6aa45-86e6-4edd-bebd-2561c346c90a.png">  

- Pick a flat without pattern pliers and pinch edges symmetrically make 3 edges. Not too deep, not to rip, not to make a hole between edges and the center.  

<img width="185" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146259969-7ab04d06-b70c-42fa-8775-43fe40d0528e.png"> <img width="121" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146259912-c735cd31-158b-4b3c-99e1-6f897ea74d2b.png">  

- To weld effectively, cut the edges downward or flat from the center with the nipper.

- Confirm there is no hole before welding with the stereo microscope.

- Now you are ready to weld.

# Welding
- __Supply__: Welder
- Turn on the welding machine. The button is right behind. Make sure turn on the Argon gas to prevent oxidation of metal during welding.  
<img width="426" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146050763-aaee7e24-f489-481f-87db-447f07c347b9.png">  

- Once you use, pen tip goes round and oxidized (color purple or dark). Put out the pen and sharpening pen tip to accurately weld by diamond disc and check with the magnifier. When you push little black switch, diamond disc will turn on.  

<img width="369" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146260398-ae5c5528-11b7-4f8d-bb57-4e35c4220ca8.png">  

- Adjust pen tip length, fits with right standard.

- When you touch the screen or push the round button, the monitor will turn on. Power and time varies with thickness and metal type. Pt (20%, 7ms) / Au-Pd (30%, 5ms)
- At the bottom of the monitor, there are five modes about welding type. Normally stick to the left first one.
- Now the tong is negative conductive and the pen is positive conductive. When they meet, the spark comes out.   

<img width="285" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146260892-07ba3a06-e0bb-415e-90a6-27441bf414c8.png">  

- The spark is harmful for eyes, so let others in the lab to know that you are welding so that they do not look the welding scene. See through the lens is safe.
- Follow welding order below figure.  

<img width="158" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146261114-41f92c2e-1f28-4215-9899-afc1b0d264e8.png">  

- Observe with the stereo microscope to make sure there is no leakage.

# Flattening
- __Supply__: blank metal
- Using metal (smaller number, large diameter) which size fits with your capsule, put the capsule into the hole with the welded side to the top.
- With the blank metal rounded edge, makes edge not to be pointy because the capsule can be ripped when it is extruded.  
<img width="290" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146261592-e11fa9e4-44a8-48cd-ad70-33fbb48aca6f.png">

- Check the flattened side and repeat press until enough flattened.

# Fill the capsule
- __Supply__: Weighing paper, tape, scissors, holed plate, spatula, blank metal
- Before filling the capsule, recommend [annealate](###Annealation) again to clean the capsule. 
- Place a capsule at the fitted hole.  

<img width="282" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146262304-0440a612-2d3e-4266-9604-5d0db229dc69.png">  

- Cut the weighing paper and make a little funnel. 
- Cross cut the weighing paper center to prevent lose powder during filling.
- Put the powder using small spatula.
- Press the powder using flat part of the blank metal fitting with the capsule diameter to make it compact.  

<img width="272" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146262455-915e9aa0-37b0-48d9-a2e4-e49d84c0b587.png">  

- If you are done with the filling, press it using hand press to make it compact.
- Clean the powder in the inner wall of the capsule using weighing paper to weld it perfectly.

# Close the capsule
- __Supply__: enclosing machine, holed plate
- Place filld capsule on the holed plate, enclosing the capsule same with above [enclosing](###Enclosing), [welding](###Welding), and [flattening](###Flattening) part.
- After close the capsule, you can check the leakage by heating up and comparing the mass difference.

# Making sleeve
- Turn on the oven and increase temperature to around 400C with the output button (Lower than target temperature to adjust oven and then increase temperature step by step).

- Place lubricated metal on the plate and set the funnel. Hold the mandrel and put the stick into the hole as a guide for sleeve and make sure it goes through the bottom mandrel. Now you can pour the ingredients.  

<img width="291" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89265413/146265759-d6eed1d5-fb56-458a-9817-5926f9a017f0.png">  

- Remove the funnel and press the stick by hands until you can't see the joint between mandrel and stick.
- Check the recipe pressure.
- Except two, make sure every valve is closed.
- Turn on the switch to press and make sure the stick is centered before the press touches the stick. 
- If it is centered, pressure up until your target pressure.
- Wait about 10 seconds and release the pressure gently with two hands.
- Then remove the metal and give a pressure to pull out the sleeve. Stop pressure and release it when the stick and metal comes out. Then take your sleeve carefully.

- Then put your pressed sleeve to oven.

### MgO assembly
- Assembly is going to be like the below figure.
- Fasten the MgO stick with hole.
- Drill from the small to the large slowly until the target diameter. It is wiggling, so the hole diameter might be larger than drill. Thus, keep check.
- Cut the assembly compositions with the saw and assemble.

### Lead lubricant
- Cut the lead foil (1-3/8 * 2-7/8 inch).
- Roll the cylindrical metal to smooth the foil surface.
