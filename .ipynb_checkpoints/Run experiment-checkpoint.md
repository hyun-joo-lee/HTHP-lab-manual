# Prepare thermocouple
- Check the 2-1/8 inch of Aluminium Oxide having four holes with pencil.

- Break the 2-1/8 inch of Aluminium Oxide with hands.
- Choose your thermocouple as your purpose (Tungsten or Platinium).
- Loosen the wire and expose tip using a flat plier. Try not to touch the thermocouple metal, rather use plastic part.

- Put the wire into the holes like below figure.

- Make sure there is no connection between + and - except the tip.

# Setting the assembly
- 

# Increase pressure 
- Make sure all of the valves are closed. Then turn on the compressed air.
- Open 'Large ram' until pressure needle points blue zone and close the valve. Make sure not to fasten the valve too much. Unless, it will be hard when you open the valve.Consider pressure goes a little bit high while the experiment runs. Pressure will not increase until all the discs are touched. Please increase the pressure slowly.
- Connect the water line and electricity. Water line with the black tape is the bottom. Make sure they do not touch the pillars and tightened very hard especially the electricity.
- Open the water line. Check the bubbles are coming out and no leakeage.
- Now open 'Small ram' until 50 Heiss bar to make sure all of the assembly parts touch each other. Same like large ram, not to much close, slow increase.

# Increase temperature
- Before increase the temperature, check the SP (set point) and OP (operation point) are set to 0. 
- Now you can turn on the furnace
- Starting OP would be 6.6. Write down the voltage, amphere, OP, Pressure, and temperature.
- Increase the temperature and increase pressure.
